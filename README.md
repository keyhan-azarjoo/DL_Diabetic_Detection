Title: Developing a Deep Learning-Based Diabetes Incidence Prediction System for Improved Disease Management

Description:
Diabetes, a chronic health problem, stems from an imbalance in glucose regulation within the body. This lifelong condition manifests when blood glucose levels are abnormally high and is associated with a wide range of consequences, including increased mortality rates. As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, it is imperative to devise innovative strategies for its prevention and treatment. However, current disease management techniques have drawbacks, particularly in terms of user comfort and accessibility.

Recent research has demonstrated that constructing a disease management system using machine learning can provide highly accurate predictions of diabetes occurrences in adults. In this project, we present a diabetes incidence prediction system that utilizes a multilayer perceptron neural network. By leveraging this system, users can input basic data, enhancing the simplicity and accessibility of making predictions.

Our research focuses on the development of a decision support system for diabetes prediction, utilizing various machine learning methods. We explore widely used classifiers such as MLP Classifier, MLP Regression, and Keras Sequential methods for predicting diabetes. To facilitate our study, we examine a dataset sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
